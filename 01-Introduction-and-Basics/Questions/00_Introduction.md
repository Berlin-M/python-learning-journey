## An Important Message Before Starting the Exercises

Congratulations! You have completed the first section of the basic concepts. Now it is time to challenge your knowledge by solving real problems. These exercises are the most important part of your learning journey. Please read the following key principles carefully before you begin.

### üß† Rule #1: Say "No" to Artificial Intelligence

Under no circumstances should you use artificial intelligence tools (like ChatGPT, Gemini, etc.) to directly solve these problems. AI gives you the final answer without any effort, and this completely distracts you from the main goal of learning, which is **the effort of problem-solving**. The process of thinking, making mistakes, and arriving at the solution is the learning itself.

### üîç Rule #2: Searching is a Superpower

In contrast, searching on Google, Stack Overflow, or reading the official Python documentation is not only allowed but **highly encouraged**. Learning how to search for solutions to your small problems is one of the most vital skills for any programmer.

### ‚úÖ Rule #3: Trust Your Knowledge

Be assured that **all the concepts and tools necessary to solve these exercises have been covered in the past lessons**. If you get stuck on a question, instead of getting discouraged, go back to the previous tutorial files (`.py`) and review the material. The answer is there!

### üí™ The Philosophy of Practice and Real Learning

The goal of these exercises is not just to get the correct answer, but to engage in the **process of finding the answer**.

-   **Spend Hours on It:** If you have to, spend hours thinking about a single problem and do not get tired. Programming is about perseverance in problem-solving.
-   **Try Different Code:** Try one approach. If it fails, test another way. Break your code, read the errors, and try to fix it. Deep learning happens in this very cycle of trying and correcting.
-   **Why is this beneficial?** By solving these problems yourself, you strengthen your "problem-solving muscle," solidify your understanding far more deeply than by just reading, and gain the confidence needed to face real-world challenges.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Final Note: These Exercises Are Mandatory

Completing these exercises is a **mandatory** and inseparable part of this course. They are designed to transform your theoretical knowledge into practical, usable skills. Do not skip them.

Now, with this mindset, go tackle the first challenge. Good luck!
