### Challenge Question 1: Smart Item Divider

**Goal:** Write a program that takes the total number of items and the capacity of each box from the user, then calculates how many boxes will be completely filled and how many items will be left over.

**Steps:**
1.  Get the total number of items from the user (e.g., `127`).
2.  Get the capacity of each box from the user (e.g., `10`).
3.  Convert both inputs to the integer (`int`) type.
4.  Calculate how many boxes will be **completely** filled.
5.  Calculate how many items will be **left over** after filling the boxes.
6.  Display the results in a clear and complete message to the user.

**Sample Output:**

```text
Enter the total number of items: 127
Enter the capacity of each box: 10
You will have 12 full box(es) and 7 item(s) will be left over.
```
>**Hint:** To solve this problem, you will need to use the floor division (//) and modulo (%) operators.
